# Acode-VsCode-bridge

this plugin is in my mind i have a simple Idea ðŸ’¡ so that the users can able to get the same and updated files while coding on VsCode editor or Acode app it will work in a simple way

it will ask user for login using the drive or store locally gmail and its password then each time it will automatically sync that specific data to the drive or gmail 

while accessing it will simply check the hidden file stored on locally and globally too and compare its version if it's not matches then it's updated files and data from that account using the saved mail password or session




concept is simple and straightforward we are simply manipulating data between two systems and google drive with the help of this plugin
